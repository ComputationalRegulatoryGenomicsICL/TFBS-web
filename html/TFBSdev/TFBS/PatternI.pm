=head1 NAME

TFBS::PatternI - interface definition for all pattern objects (currently includes only matrices)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TFBS::PatternI is a draft class that should contain general interface for matrix and other (future) pattern objects. It is not defined and not used yet, as I need to ponder over certain unresolved issues in general pattern definition. User feedback is more than welcome.

=head1 FEEDBACK

Please send bug reports and other comments to the author.
